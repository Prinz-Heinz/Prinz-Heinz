#### The young man went out onto the ballroom floor. A thin layer of dust had settled since he had last come here. Holding his battered hat, he sat down on a stool by the far side of the room. He remembered those years ago. Before the war. He was a tad more handsome, but leages and miles more troublesome and cocky. He believed himself quite the dancer and none dared correct him. Until she came. He had stretched out his hand in a sultry and mocking way but she took it none the less. Her soft hands gently guided him around the room and for a second he wasn't just "dancing"....... he was flying. As the music came to a slow end he could only ask for one more dance with her. She spoke with the quietest whisper, using a voice smoother than the finest silk and sweeter than the honeysuckle blossoms. "Perhaps one day...." She had spoke. That day however had not come for him. Only weeks later war had swept across the land and he was forced to trade his fine silks for a uniform. Every battle he survived ate away at his body more and more until the end of it. He stood and scratched at his deep brown beard before turning to leave, the old scars on his body aching with there usual dull pain. And there he saw her. The lines under her eyes showed signs of were and stress but still held the youthful beauty they once had. She held out her hand. He took it. And once again, he flew.
